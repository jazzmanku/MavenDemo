    1. Create an array of integers and print them
    2. Create multiple Intro.Arrays and store the multiplication table of any number of your choice.
        e.g.    7 x 1 = 7
                7 x 2 = 14
        first array or variable = 7
        second array = 1 to 10
        3rd Array = "first array [index] x 2nd array[index] = product"
    3. Bonus:
        Make the 2nd example dynamic, based on input - 7, 10, 13
